# Custom Neural Networks 🧠

Personal project on custom neural networks with manual computing of the **back-propagation from scratch** (the math is provided in the pdf file).

Two implementations for classifying synthetic timeseries:

- A custom 1-layer **Transformer Encoder** via class-token prediction
- A custom 2-layer **Feed-Forward Network**

***Note:** The correctness of the computed gradients is assessed by using PyTorch AutoGrad as a reference.*
